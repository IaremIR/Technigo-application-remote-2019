              <span class="tool" data-tip="important">Hypertext markup language (HTML)</span> is the major markup language
              used to display Web pages on the Internet. Web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images or
              other resources through a Web browser.
              The file extension for an HTML file is .htm or .html.
              New Web developers may mistake HTML for a programming language when it is actually a markup language. HTML is used
              with other technologies because all HTML really does is organize documents. On the client side, JavaScript (JS) is
              used to provide interactivity. On the server side, a Web development platform (Ruby, PHP or ASP.NET ). The line
              between server-side development and client side development is technologies like AJAX.
              When a Web developer builds an application, the work is performed on the server, and raw HTML is sent out to the
              user. HTML5 is the update made to HTML from HTML4. 
              It uses the same basic rules as HTML4, but adds some new tags and
              attributes which allow for better semantics and for dynamic elements that are activated using <span class="tool" data-tip="interesting">JavaScript</span>.
